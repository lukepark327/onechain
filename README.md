Assist you to develop blockchain core easily.
> [2018 OSS Grand Developers Challenge Award](https://project.oss.kr)   
> Based on the following code: [lhartikk/naivechain](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain)   

## Abstract
![structure](https://github.com/twodude/onechain/blob/master/images/structure.png)

As Blockchain-based service grew, so need of open source which assists developing blockchain core was drived.
Although there are some open source projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, those are too difficult to learn and to use.

You can solve the above problems by using
**```one-chain```, simple implementation of blockchain core.**
The one-chain is modularized by function: network, core, transaction, wallet, etc. to achieve clarity.
Also, detail comments and documents are provided for studying and easy reusing.
Most of the code is written in a pseudo-code style to provide understanding by other language developers.

### Get blockchain
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blocks
```

You can pretty-print JSON with:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blocks | python -m json.tool
```
Python >= 2.6 required.

### Get a specific block

Get a block whose number (index) is 3:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/block/3
```

### Add new block
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data "{\"data\" : [\"Anything you want\", \"Anything you need\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
```

### Get connected peers
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/peers
```

### Add peer
```bash
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data "{\"peers\" : [\"ws://127.0.0.1:6002\", \"ws://127.0.0.1:6003\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:3001/addPeers
```

### Get Address

```

# one-chain explorer
![explorer](https://github.com/twodude/onechain/blob/master/images/explorer.png)

**`one-chain explorer`** is the front-end for the blockchain explorer which is used to visualize the state of the blockchain. Via blockchain explorer, you can see the latest blocks and details about a specific block.

`one-chain` already has multiple functions with HTTP (RESTful API) endpoints, so a web page just calls those endpoints and visualizes the results. The whole UI codes are located in `./explorer`. `Vue.js` and `Vuetify` are used to implement.

# How to Start
```bash
cd explorer
npm install
```

## Run
```bash
npm run serve
```

**Note that** there is at least one running node whose `HTTP_PORT` is `3001`.

Now app is running at http://localhost:8080/ by default. Using 'Chrome browser' is recommended.

# How to Use

You can search a specific block by block number. Use search bar or click the `BLOCK #N` button.
